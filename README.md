# Project Title

## Overview
This project is a Java-based web application using Spring Boot. The project is structured into two main directories: `backend/` and `database/`.

## Backend
The `backend/` directory contains the source code for the application. It includes a `Dockerfile` for containerizing the application, and a `Main.java` file which likely contains the entry point for the application. The `simpleapi/` directory within `backend/` contains the Maven wrapper scripts (`mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd`), which are used to ensure a consistent Maven environment for building the project. The `pom.xml` file indicates that the project uses the `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-test` dependencies.

## Database
The `database/` directory contains SQL scripts (`CreateSchema.sql` and `InsertData.sql`) which are likely used to set up the application's database. It also contains a `Dockerfile`, suggesting that the database can also be containerized.

## .gitignore
The `.gitignore` file lists the files and directories that Git should ignore. These typically include build artifacts, IDE-specific files, and other non-source-code files.
